# Current State

This is prototype code. Some features have yet to be implimented:
- Start with Windows
- Crackle Fix (for bypassing USB interface pops in some cases)

The volume and mute sync currently work

This codebase is *mildly dirty*, which will be corrected once feature prototyping is complete.

# Developement Environment

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) _(Check to add python to environmental variables)_
- [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.15.04/) _(Right click > Run as Administrator)_

Once you have the above tools installed as described, you will need to reboot your computer.
